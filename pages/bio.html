            <h2>Meet Amanda</h2>
            <p>My name is Amanda and I am 32 years old. I am a student at Kenzie Academy, and I am working towards my
                UX/UI Engineering Certificate.
                I have two children, Aria (8) and Ezra (1), and they are my motivation for all that I do.
                Prior to continuing my education I was a school teacher. It was a great joy in my life for 5 years, 
                but it always felt as if something was missing. Kenzie Academy has helped me find that missing piece,
                and now I am pursuing a career in UX/UI Engineering and loving every minute!
